Angara.in Selenium Checkout Automation Script
This Selenium automation script is designed to automate the checkout flow on Angara.in, allowing for efficient and reliable testing of the checkout process.

Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from Python's official website.

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.

Install the required Python packages by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
After installing the required packages, execute the automation script by running:

python main.py
The script will launch a browser (Chrome) and navigate to Angara.in.

It will then proceed through the checkout flow, filling in necessary details and completing the purchase process.

Once the checkout flow is complete, the script will provide feedback regarding the success or failure of the process.

Review the console output and any generated log files for detailed information on the test execution.

Notes

Make sure to review the code in main.py and customize it according to your specific testing needs.
This script assumes a default checkout flow on Angara.in. Any changes to the website's structure or flow may require corresponding updates to the script.
